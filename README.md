# Seasonal Styles

A starting point for experimentation with jQuery.

Part of the current IT121 class.
 

Context: Our scenario will be to build a single web page for seasonal wear outfitters, Eddie Browser.  They want content that will change based on the season, including a look and feel, logo etc.  

Deliverables: Using jQuery, create a page that promotes a unique look and feel for each of the four seasons by changing a page in the 4 following areas:

A unique color scheme, for example stylesheet or background color, etc.
A unique logo, for example a picture of a snowflake for winter, etc.
A unique item of clothing, for example a parka for winter.
A unique string of text identifying the season, for example "Leap into our Fall Wear!"
